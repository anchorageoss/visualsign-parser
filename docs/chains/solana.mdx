---

The Solana module handles transactions with multiple instructions, program invocations, and SPL token operations.

## Architecture overview

### Transaction model
- **Encoding**: Borsh/Bincode serialization
- **Instruction-based**: Multiple instructions per transaction
- **Account Model**: Accounts owned by programs
- **Fee Model**: Fixed base fee with optional priority fees

### Key components

The Solana parser handles:
- System program transfers
- SPL Token operations
- Associated Token Account (ATA) creation
- Multiple instructions per transaction
- Program invocations

## Transaction structure

Solana transactions consist of:
1. **Signatures**: One or more transaction signatures
2. **Message**: Contains the actual transaction data
   - Account keys (all accounts involved)
   - Instructions (operations to execute)
   - Recent blockhash (for replay protection)

## Instruction types

### System program
- SOL transfers between accounts
- Account creation and initialization
- Space allocation for data storage

### SPL token program
- Token transfers
- Token approvals
- Mint and burn operations

### Associated token account
- Automatic creation of token accounts
- Deterministic addressing for user tokens

## Visualization strategy

- **Primary Information** - Display the most significant instruction as the title, with supporting instructions shown as steps
- **Multiple Instructions** - Group related instructions together, showing them as a sequence of operations
- **Account Context** - Show account ownership and program associations when relevant

## Implementation details

Source code available at:
- [Solana Parser](https://github.com/anchorageoss/visualsign-parser/tree/main/src/chain_parsers/visualsign-solana)

## Supported programs

The parser recognizes common Solana programs:
- System Program
- SPL Token Program
- SPL Associated Token Account Program
- Custom programs via IDL (Interface Definition Language)

## Example transaction types

- **SOL Transfer** - Simple transfer of native SOL between accounts
- **SPL Token Transfer** - Transfer of SPL tokens, often including ATA creation if needed
- **Complex DeFi Transaction** - Multiple instructions working together (e.g., create account, transfer tokens, interact with DEX)
