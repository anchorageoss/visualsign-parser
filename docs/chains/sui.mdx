description: Object model, Move calls, and programmable transactions
---

The Sui module handles the Move programming language and Sui's object-centric data model.

## Architecture overview

### Transaction model
- **Encoding**: BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization)
- **Object-based**: Resources are objects with unique IDs
- **Move Language**: Type-safe smart contract language
- **Gas Model**: Storage and computation fees

### Key components

The Sui parser handles:
- Object transfers
- Move function calls
- Coin operations (split, merge)
- Programmable transactions
- Package publishing

## Transaction types

### Programmable transactions
Sui's programmable transactions allow multiple operations in a single transaction:
- Multiple Move calls
- Object transfers
- Coin operations
- All executed atomically

### Object model
- **Owned Objects**: Belong to a specific address
- **Shared Objects**: Accessible by multiple transactions
- **Immutable Objects**: Read-only after creation

## Visualization strategy

- **Command Sequence** - Show programmable transaction commands as a sequence of operations
- **Object Information** - Display object IDs and ownership when relevant to the transaction
- **Gas Objects** - Show gas payment details including storage rebates

## Implementation details

- [Sui Parser](https://github.com/anchorageoss/visualsign-parser/tree/main/src/chain_parsers/visualsign-sui)

## Common operations

- **SUI Transfer** - Transfer of native SUI tokens between addresses
- **Object Transfer** - Moving owned objects from one address to another
- **Move Function Call** - Invoking functions in deployed Move modules
- **Coin Split/Merge** - Operations to divide or combine coin objects
