title: Contributing a Visualization
description: Add transaction support for your DApp or protocol
---

You do not need Rust experience to contribute a visualization. This guide covers the workflow for adding support for your DApp's transactions.

## Before you start

Make sure you understand:
- [Field types](/field-types) available for building visualizations
- [Creating visualizations](/creating-visualizations) design patterns

## Contribution workflow

### 1. Fork the repository

Fork [visualsign-parser](https://github.com/anchorageoss/visualsign-parser) on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

### 2. Create your visualization

Add a JSON preset file for your protocol in the appropriate chain directory:

```
src/chain_parsers/visualsign-<chain>/src/presets/<your-protocol>/
```

Each preset file defines how to decode and display a specific transaction type. See existing presets (like Uniswap, Jupiter, or Cetus) for examples.

### 3. Test with parser CLI

Use the [parser CLI](/parser-cli) to verify your visualization works correctly.

```bash
# Build the CLI
cd visualsign-parser/src
cargo build --release

# Test with a real transaction
./target/release/parser_cli --chain <chain> -t <transaction_hex> --output human
```

Run both expanded and condensed views:

```bash
# Full view
./target/release/parser_cli --chain ethereum -t <tx_hex> --output human

# Hardware wallet view
./target/release/parser_cli --chain ethereum -t <tx_hex> --output human --condensed-only
```

### 4. Submit a pull request

Open a pull request with:
- Your preset file(s)
- At least one test case with a real mainnet transaction
- A brief description of your protocol

## What reviewers look for

### Accuracy

- Field values match the raw transaction data
- Addresses, amounts, and parameters are correctly decoded
- Protocol name and function names are accurate

### Clarity

- A non-technical user can understand what the transaction does
- Labels are action-oriented ("You're sending" not just "Amount")
- Important information is visible in the condensed view

### Completeness

- All relevant parameters are displayed
- Risk indicators are included where appropriate (large amounts, new addresses)
- Both expanded and condensed views work well

### Consistency

- Follows existing visualization patterns for similar operations
- Uses appropriate [field types](/field-types) for each data type
- Matches the style of other visualizations on the same chain

## Testing checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Parser CLI produces correct output for your transaction type
- [ ] Condensed view shows the most critical information
- [ ] Amounts display with correct decimals and token symbols
- [ ] Addresses are properly formatted for the chain
- [ ] Test with multiple real transactions, not just one
