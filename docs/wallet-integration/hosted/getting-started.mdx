description: Integrate with VisualSign via Turnkey's hosted enclave service
---

{/*
TODO: Fill in when Turnkey integration details are available.
*/}

Turnkey operates VisualSign parser instances in AWS Nitro Enclaves, providing transaction parsing with attestation verification without requiring you to manage enclave infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Turnkey account with API credentials
- Understanding of [attestation verification](../self-hosted-tee/attestation)

## Integration overview

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Your Wallet
    participant T as Turnkey API
    participant E as Nitro Enclave

    W->>T: Parse request + raw transaction
    T->>E: Forward to enclave
    E->>E: Parse transaction
    E->>T: Parsed output + attestation
    T->>W: Response with attestation
    W->>W: Verify attestation
    W->>W: Display to user
```

## Getting started

<Note>
Integration details coming soon. Contact Turnkey for early access.
</Note>

## Attestation verification

Even with a hosted solution, you must verify attestations. The attestation document proves:

1. The response came from a genuine AWS Nitro Enclave
2. The enclave is running the expected VisualSign parser code
3. The parsed output hasn't been tampered with

See [Attestation Verification](../self-hosted-tee/attestation) for implementation details.

## API reference

The hosted API uses the same gRPC interface as self-hosted deployments. See [gRPC API Reference](../../api-reference) for message formats and examples.
