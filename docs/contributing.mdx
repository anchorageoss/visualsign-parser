Thank you for your interest in contributing to VisualSign Parser. This guide covers the universal contribution workflow applicable to all contributors.

## Governance

For details about authority, Core Team structure, and decision-making, see [Governance](/about#governance).

## Contribution workflow

### For community contributors

1. **Fork** the [visualsign-parser](https://github.com/anchorageoss/visualsign-parser) repository
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** following the code style and practices in this project
4. **Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** if this is your first contribution. The CLA check will prompt you with instructions if needed.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes
6. **Wait for Core Team review**. A Core Team member will review and approve your PR before it can be merged.

### For Core Team members

Core Team members can review, approve, and merge PRs from community contributors and other Core Team members. Follow the same PR workflow but with merge authority.

## PR guidelines

- **Clear description**: Explain what problem your PR solves and how it solves it
- **Test coverage**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Code style**: Follow existing code conventions in the repository
- **One concern per PR**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix

## Code standards

Before submitting, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Format code
make -C src fmt

# Run linter and fix issues
make -C src lint

# Run tests
make -C src test
```

Additional guidelines:
- Format your code using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- Address all linter warnings
- Ensure all tests pass
- No breaking changes without discussion

## Building OCI containers

This repository uses [StageX](https://stagex.tools) to build OCI containers.

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop 26 or later with containerd enabled (Settings then "Use containerd for pulling and storing images")
- Linux: Add to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
  ```json
  {"features": {"containerd-snapshotter": true}}
  ```

### Build commands

```bash
# Parser app container
make out/parser_app/index.json

# Parser host container
make out/parser_host/index.json

# Non-OCI versions
make non-oci-docker-images
```
